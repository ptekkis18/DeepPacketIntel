# DeepPacketIntel
DeepPacketIntel is a digital forensics project build around a simulated scenario to showcase invastigating skills in packet analysis while identifying suspicious network activities, extracting key information and ultimately uncovering 
the adversary's point of entry inside the network.

## Scenario Overview 
It has been identified that an organisation has suffered from a major data breach revealing personal information of employees to adversaries. 

The system administrators have been made aware of the situation from the media and they need to investigate their network and identify the adverary's point of entry in order to stop further damage from occuring.

They believe that their monitoring system has captured the adversary's point of entry as they suspect some of their employees' comptuers to have been infected.

The goal is to examine the .pcap files using wireshark, identify the main employees and their IPs using the network at the time period where the attack occurred, find and report any suspicious activities from their devices and finally find the entry of the attacker in order to suspend it.

Present the above in a well structured professional investigation document.
